PowerCLI-Deployments
====================

VMware PowerShell Deployment

This is a script that will allow (non-technical) users to deploy virtual machines very quickly without using the desktop or Flash based web client. 

The script will have to be modified slightly to suit your environment, but this should be fairly easy to do. My end goal is to replace much of the functionality used day to day to deploy virtual machines in VMware with a simple interview process. 

While I’m a large fan of VMware I’m dismayed by their decision to move to a Flash based web client. My goal is that people will be able to deploy servers more rapidly and with a higher level of consistency. This also gives me fun project to work on my PowerShell / PowerCLI  scripting.
